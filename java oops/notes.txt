class:- entire set of data & code of on object. it is a user defined data type.
        it creates no.of objects
		Ex: fruit is a class
		class classname{
		   data members;
		   members functions;
		}
		
object:- int x;            
		 class subname;      
		 sample s;
				
->it is a basic runtime entity
->it is instance of a class		

Encapsulation:- The wrapping up of data & functions into a single unit is called 
                Encapsulation. 
				
Inheritance:- Acquiring the properties of one class to another class.

class A{
}
class B extends A{
}

Polymorphism:- ability to take more than one form.
            Ex: function overloading
			sum(){
			}
			sum(int x, int y){
			}
			
Dynamic Binding:- Static - compile time  (private,final,static)
                  Dynamic - Run Time     (virtual)
				  
				Binding
                -Static
                -Dynamic

Message Communication:- 

                obj 1------->obj 2
                  |            |
                  |--->obj3<---|	 

Data Hiding:- In this data can be accessed only in the functions of same class.

Data Abstraction:- (ADT)	Ex:- ATM
                     |
				   class
The technique of craeting new data type are called abstract data type the concept
is called data abstraction.
