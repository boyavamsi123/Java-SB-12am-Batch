Forms of operator:-
Unary Operator:-
An operator that works only one operand is called as unary operator
Ex:-a++ or a-- or b++ or b-- or --a or --b
Binary operator:-
An operator that works with two operands is called as binary operator
Ex:-a+b,a-b,a*b,a/b etc...
Ternary Operator:-
An operators that works with three operands or expression.(a>b)?a is big : b is big
