Error vs Exception : 

Error : 
most of the cases errors are not caused by our program & these are due to lack of system resources.
Error are non-recordable.

then the program will be terminated abnormally. System or Server Admin is responsible 
for increasing Heap Memory.


Exception : Most of the cases exceptions are caused by our program & these are recovarable
